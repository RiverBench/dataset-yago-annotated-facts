# yago-annotated-facts (development version)

This is a subset of the [YAGO 4 knowledge base](https://yago-knowledge.org/downloads/yago-4) ([paper](https://suchanek.name/work/publications/eswc-2020-yago.pdf)), based on Wikidata, [version from February 24, 2020](https://yago-knowledge.org/data/yago4/full/2020-02-24/). This dataset includes only the fact annotations in RDF-star, that is facts about facts. Each stream element corresponds to one item in Wikidata.

*This README is a snapshot of documentation for the latest development version of the dataset.
Full documentation for all versions can be found [on the website](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/yago-annotated-facts/dev).*

## Technical metadata

- **<abbr title="Inverse of stax:isUsageOf – indicates that the subject is related to a usage of an RDF stream type.

This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.

Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.  Note that 'stream type usage' is a subjective assertion and instances of this class may be annotated with additional provenance properties to explain who made the assertion.
